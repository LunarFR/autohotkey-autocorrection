To make the file execute on startup you will need to put the folder in this location.



First extract the zip file.

put the folder with the autocorrection ahk, version.ini and installer.ahk ANYWHERE YOU WANT on your pc.

After that make a shortcut to the path of autocorrection.ahk you only need to run this.


put the shortcut in this folder under here.

C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

Change C: to your main drive where you have users


after this it would maybe take 40 seconds before it runs when you startup your pc.

this ahk will autoupdate.
