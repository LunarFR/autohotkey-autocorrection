# Autohotkey-Autocorrection

## What's this ?

Autohotkey-Autocorrection is a program allowing you to correct some of your spelling mistakes while replacing your abbreviations with real sentences which will allow you to write faster! (e.g. : ty -> thank you)

## Execute on startup

To make the file execute on startup you will need to put the folder in this location.

1. Extract the zip file

2. Put the folder with the autocorrection ahk, version.ini and installer.ahk ANYWHERE YOU WANT on your pc

3. After that make a shortcut to the path of autocorrection.ahk you only need to run this.

4. Put the shortcut in this folder under here : `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

5. Change C: to your main drive where window is installed

6. Replace 'YOURUSERNAME' by your window user name

After this it would maybe take 40 seconds before it runs when you startup your pc.


**This ahk will autoupdate.**
